# Strawberry — Harness & Wiring Spec

**Target:** the glue that makes the finished crab react. OS notifications, git events, and voice all flow through one backend into a Godot desktop widget, which speaks (TTS), listens (STT), and shows a speech bubble the local model writes.

**For:** an agent (Claude Code / Codex) and the human running it.

**Assumes done:** `v2/strawberry_v2.glb` — rig, seven clips, morphs, cel shader, verified in Godot 4.7.2 (see `v2/README.md`). This spec references those names in §9; they must match.

**Assumes running:** Ollama serving Qwen3.8 on `127.0.0.1:11434`; dunst as the notification daemon; faster-whisper and Piper installed. (As of Phase 1 only Ollama is present on the machine.)

---

## 0. The one idea

Every feature is the same shape: **an event becomes one JSON message to Godot.** Notifications, git, voice: different doorways into the same hallway. Build the message path once; everything else plugs in.

There are **two hops**, and the common mistake is skipping the first:

```
short-lived event scripts ──HTTP──▶  strawberryd (daemon)  ──websocket──▶  Godot widget
(dunst script, git hook)             (brain, TTS, STT, orchestration)      (the performer)
```

Event scripts are short-lived. They must **not** each open a websocket to Godot. They fire a quick HTTP POST at the always-running daemon. The daemon holds the single Godot connection.

---

## 1. The message contract (built first, both sides implement it)

Daemon → Godot, one JSON object per performance:

```json
{
  "state": "talking",
  "anim": "notify_perk",
  "text": "Someone pushed to main again…",
  "audio": "/tmp/strawberry_line.wav",
  "emotion": "alert"
}
```

| Field | Req | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | yes | `idle` \| `listening` \| `thinking` \| `talking` \| `dancing` → the five loops |
| `anim` | no | one-shot reaction played over the state: `alert_snap` \| `notify_perk` |
| `text` | no | speech-bubble text (omit = no bubble) |
| `audio` | no | path to a wav; **present** = play + drive claws, **absent** = silent mode |
| `emotion` | no | `neutral` \| `happy` \| `alert` \| `angry` — tints bubble / picks `anim` |
| `reaction` | no | procedural recipe layered over the clip: `wave` \| `peek` \| `shiver` \| `double_hop` \| `nod` (§13) |
| `icon` | no | path to an image shown as a badge beside the bubble (the notifying app's icon) |
| `hop` | no | `true`: the window itself bounces on the desktop |

Optional fields are omitted on the wire, never sent as `null`. Unknown fields, unknown states, and missing audio files are rejected by the daemon with a 400 and a reason.

**Godot's behaviour on receipt:** apply `state` (crossfade to its loop); if `anim` present, fire it as a one-shot and resume the state's loop when it ends; if `text`, show the bubble; if `audio`, play it through the analysed bus (§6). When speech/bubble finishes and the state was `talking`, **auto-return to her resting state**: `dancing` if she was dancing before the line, otherwise `idle`. The daemon doesn't send a follow-up. `listening`/`thinking` are pipeline transients and are not remembered; `dancing` persists until the next `idle`.

**Transport:** the **daemon is the websocket server**, Godot is a **client** that connects out and auto-reconnects with backoff (1 s doubling to 8 s). localhost only. One port carries both HTTP and the websocket (`/ws`).

**Liveness, both ends.** On shutdown the daemon closes every widget socket with `1001 going away` and exits within 2 s, so a restart is noticed immediately (aiohttp would otherwise hold the handler for up to 60 s and the widget would sit on a dead socket). The widget also sends `{"type":"ping"}` every 5 s, gets `{"type":"pong"}`, and drops and reconnects after 12 s of silence, covering a half-open socket after sleep/wake. `scripts/check_reconnect.sh` (and `SIGNAL=KILL …`) proves both paths: drop noticed at 0.0 s, reconnected in 2.6 s.

Source of truth: `strawberryd/strawberryd/contract.py` and the constants at the top of `widget/widget.gd`.

---

## 2. Backend daemon — `strawberryd`

Long-running Python (asyncio, aiohttp). One port, default **8770**:

- `POST /event` — accepts `{source, app, title, body, urgency}`. This is what the hooks hit. `source` ∈ `notification|git|voice|manual`; `urgency` is normalised from dunst's `LOW|NORMAL|CRITICAL`.
- `POST /perform` — accepts a raw contract blob. For `curl`, tests, and callers that already know what they want.
- `GET /health` — `{ok, widgets, performed, uptime_s, brain: {model, loaded, calls, fallbacks, last_latency_s}}`.
- `GET /config` — the effective settings (§15).
- `GET /ws` — the widget connects here.
- **Core function:** `Daemon.perform(performance)` builds the blob, (Phase 4) runs TTS, and sends to Godot. Everything routes through it.

**What she does is owned by the daemon**, so the model never names a clip or a recipe; it only picks the emotion. `strawberryd/reactions.py` maps *(source, app/category, urgency, emotion)* to a one-shot clip, a recipe (§13), and whether the window hops:

| Event | anim | reaction | hop |
|---|---|---|---|
| notification from a messaging app (`im.*`/`email.*` category, or WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Thunderbird/…) | – | `wave` | yes |
| notification, critical urgency or `angry` | `alert_snap` | `shiver` | – |
| coalesced burst ("N notifications…") | – | `double_hop` | – |
| other notification, `alert` / `happy` / `neutral` | – / `notify_perk` / – | `peek` / – / `nod` | – |
| git `post-commit` | `notify_perk` (`alert_snap` if angry) | – | – |
| git `pre-push`, media track change, voice | – | `nod` | – |

Critical beats message (a critical WhatsApp still shivers). The app icon resolved by the doorway rides along as `icon`.

**Local tools only.** Requests carrying a browser `Origin` header are refused (403) on every route including `/ws`, and POSTs must be `Content-Type: application/json` (415 otherwise). Godot, curl, and the doorways never send `Origin`; browsers always do. Without this a web page could make her talk, or open `/ws` and read notification text as it goes past.

Run: `strawberryd/.venv/bin/strawberryd [--port 8770]` (after `uv sync`), or `bin/strawberry daemon`.

---

## 3. The brain — two paths, don't conflate them

- **Reaction path (no tools):** a notification or commit needs a fast one-liner, not tool use. `OllamaReactor` (`strawberryd/brain.py`) calls `POST /api/chat` on a **small, always-resident model** with the persona as system prompt, five example exchanges, and the output **forced to a JSON schema** `{"line": str, "emotion": neutral|happy|alert|angry}`. Thinking mode off, 1.5 s timeout, then the canned line instead. The model is loaded at daemon start with `keep_alive = -1` so the first event never waits for a cold load.
- **Action path (tools):** a voice command like "skip the track" or "log this to re:call" must call an MCP. This path runs the tool loop against your MCP servers (§8) on the big model, loaded on demand.

Both paths end by calling `perform(...)`. Route notifications/git/media → reaction path; voice → action path.

**Model choice (bake-off, `scripts/reactor_bakeoff.py`, results in `scripts/bakeoff_*.json`).** The reflex needs speed and residency, not intelligence: the 27B would cold-load for 10–20 s after a quiet half hour and hog the GPU. Among ~1B models on the Ollama library, **`gemma3:1b`** won: 815 MB, ~0.5 s warm, 0/32 schema misses, short lines (median 7 words), emotions right, and it does not invent details. `qwen3.5:0.8b` was as fast and livelier but hallucinated specifics ("Dinner Friday at 7 PM" for "dinner on Sunday?"), leaked the examples, and ran long. For a mascot reading your real notifications, saying less beats saying wrong. The decisive lever was **few-shot examples**: with the description alone Gemma answered "Interesting…" to everything; with five example exchanges it became a crab. The examples live in config (§15), so her voice is tunable without code.

The interface is `Reactor` (`strawberryd/events.py`): `async react(event) -> Performance`. `CannedReactor` (fixed line per source, no model) remains as the fallback and as `brain.enabled = false`.

---

## 4. Doorway: notifications — `doorways/notify_watch.py`

**On this machine the notification daemon is GNOME Shell, not dunst**, and dunst cannot run beside it (both claim `org.freedesktop.Notifications`). So there is no script hook. Instead the watcher opens a private **monitor connection** to the session bus (`org.freedesktop.DBus.Monitoring.BecomeMonitor`, unprivileged for the user's own bus) with a match on `Notify` method calls, and sees every notification as it goes past. GNOME still shows it normally; the watcher only listens.

`Notify(app_name, replaces_id, app_icon, summary, body, actions, hints, expire_timeout)` becomes `{source: "notification", app, title: summary, body, urgency, category, icon}`; urgency comes from the `urgency` hint byte (0/1/2 → low/normal/critical), markup and entities are stripped from the body, and `desktop-entry` stands in when an app sends no name. `icon` is the app's icon resolved on disk: `app_icon` if it is a path, else the `.desktop` file's `Icon=`, the desktop-entry id, or the app name, looked up under `~/.local/share/icons`, `/usr/share/icons/{hicolor,Yaru,Adwaita}`, `/var/lib/snapd/desktop/icons` and `/usr/share/pixmaps` (SVG or PNG). No icon found means no badge, nothing else changes.

**What gets forwarded** is `[notifications]` in the config (§15):

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `ignore_apps` | `["Spotify"]` | music is already covered by the media doorway |
| `only_apps` | `[]` | non-empty: forward these apps only |
| `min_urgency` | `"low"` | drop anything below |
| `include_body` | `true` | `false`: she knows *who* wrote, not *what* ("message from James", body never reaches the model) |
| `max_body_chars` | `200` | |
| `ignore_replacements` | `true` | updates to an existing notification (download progress) |
| `coalesce_s` | `2.0` | several inside the window become one event: "7 notifications from Slack" / "3 notifications", highest urgency wins |

Her own notifications (app `strawberry`) are always ignored. This is also how WhatsApp / Messenger reach her: you react to the **desktop notification**, never their APIs. A machine running dunst could post the same event from a `dunstrc` `script =` rule.

## 4b. Doorway: media (MPRIS) — `doorways/mpris_watch.py`

Any player that speaks MPRIS (Spotify, VLC, Rhythmbox, browser tabs with media) registers as `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.<name>` on the session bus. The watcher follows **all of them at once** with PyGObject/Gio, no extra tools, and reacts to the union:

| Change | Daemon call |
|---|---|
| any player → Playing | `POST /perform {"state":"dancing"}` |
| nothing playing / player quits | `POST /perform {"state":"idle"}` |
| a playing player changes track | `POST /event {"source":"media","app":"<player Identity>","title":"Artist — Title"}` |

Changes are debounced 400 ms (players fire several property updates per track), a track is announced once per player, and un-pausing the same song is not an announcement. A dance/idle post the daemon could not take (it restarts at the same moment as the watcher under systemd) is retried every 2 s until it lands; track announcements are not. The daemon in turn remembers her resting state (`idle`|`dancing`, shown in `/health`) and sends it to any widget the moment it connects, so a relaunched widget does not stand still while the music plays. `--only spotify,vlc` or `--ignore firefox` narrow it. `bin/strawberry` starts the watcher next to the daemon. This is why the widget returns to `dancing` rather than `idle` after a line (§1): the music context outlives the reaction.

---

## 4c. Doorway: the beat — `doorways/beat_watch.py` + `doorways/beat_track.py`

MPRIS says *that* music plays; this says *how it goes*. The watcher captures the player's own PipeWire output stream (`pw-record --target <node>`: never the microphone, never the whole mixer, so her voice, calls and system sounds stay out) and feeds it to a pure-numpy beat tracker: spectral-flux onset envelope at ~43 frames/s, autocorrelation over the last 8 s for the period (60–190 BPM, mild prior around 120), a comb filter over the last 4 s for the phase, with kick-band onsets leading the phase search so she lands on the kick rather than the hi-hats. Every 2 s it posts to `POST /tempo`:

```json
{"bpm": 128.4, "period_s": 0.467, "confidence": 0.71, "next_beat": 1789935826.592,
 "evenness": 0.62, "low_ratio": 0.55, "density": 4.1, "loudness_db": -18.0}
```

or `{"silent": true}`. `next_beat` is wall-clock, so the widget computes the beat phase itself every frame. `evenness` (autocorrelation at 1, 2 and 4 periods: four-on-the-floor scores high), `low_ratio` (energy below 150 Hz), `density` (onsets/s) and loudness are the style features. The daemon validates ranges, forwards `{"tempo": {...}}` to the widgets, shows the fresh estimate in `/health`, and hands it to a widget that connects while it is fresh (6 s). Stream discovery is automatic (a running `Stream/Output/Audio` node from a known player, else any running stream that is not ours) or pinned with `[beat].target`.

**Dance styles (`widget/dance_style.gd`).** While she is dancing with a fresh estimate the node runs `dance_loop` at the music's tempo (one leg lift per beat: the clip's natural rate is 119 BPM, halved or doubled to stay within 0.65–1.6×) and layers beat-locked moves over it, the same bone-offset-after-the-AnimationPlayer technique as the reactions. The rule table, in order:

| style | when | moves |
|---|---|---|
| `sway` | confidence < 0.3, or < 76 BPM, or quieter than −38 dB | slow roll, clip at 0.75×, happy eyes; no beat lock |
| `rave` | ≥ 118 BPM, evenness ≥ 0.45, low_ratio ≥ 0.25 (techno, house, trance, hardstyle) | stomp squash on every beat, arms pump alternately, eyes wide |
| `headbang` | ≥ 132 BPM, density ≥ 4 (rock, metal) | forward nod on the beat, claws half up, squint |
| `groove` | ≤ 108 BPM, low_ratio ≥ 0.2 (hip hop, funk) | two-beat roll, claw pumps on alternate beats |
| `bounce` | everything else with a beat | squash and a small nod on the beat |

A new style must win two estimates in a row (4 s) before she switches, so borderline songs do not flicker. Silence or a stale estimate resets speed and layers. The thresholds are constants at the top of the script and the watcher logs the same features per song, so tuning is: play the song, read the journal, adjust. First live reading: Schrotthagen at 161 BPM, evenness 0.5, low 0.77 → rave. Not built yet: a build-up/drop detector for rave (energy rising over bars, then a crouch and a drop back in) and a genre hint from the brain.

## 5. Doorway: git — `doorways/git/`

Global by construction: hooks run inside the `git` binary when the commit or push happens, so a terminal, Claude Code, Codex, opencode, or an IDE all fire the same hook. One line makes them apply to every repo on the machine, present and future:

```bash
doorways/git/install.sh        # symlinks the hooks into ~/.config/git/hooks and sets core.hooksPath
doorways/git/install.sh --remove
```

| Hook | Event posted |
|---|---|
| `post-commit` | `{source:"git", app:"post-commit", title:"<repo>", body:"<commit subject>"}` |
| `pre-push` | `{source:"git", app:"pre-push", title:"<repo>", body:"pushing N commits on <branch> to <remote>"}` (skipped for branch deletions) |

`app` carries the hook name so the reactor can shade the reaction. Both go through `strawberry-git-event`, which builds the JSON with `jq`, detaches the `curl` with `setsid`, gives up after one second, and always exits 0: a hook must never slow or break git, and a stopped daemon just means she doesn't react.

Two things the hooks take care of:

- **A global `core.hooksPath` replaces per-repo `.git/hooks`**, so each hook ends by handing over to the repo's own hook of the same name if one exists (pre-push replays its stdin to it). Repos that set `core.hooksPath` locally (husky-style) win over the global one; add a call to `strawberry-git-event` in their hook if you want her there too.
- **Only this machine's git fires.** Commits elsewhere, GitHub web merges, and CI results reach her through the notification doorway (§4). `post-merge`/`post-rewrite` are deliberately not installed for now; they'd make her chatty.

---

## 6. TTS + speech bubble (Godot side)

The reply text goes **two places at once**: to Piper (wav) and into the blob's `text`.

- **Piper (`strawberryd/speech.py`):** `Daemon.perform()` hands any line without `audio` to `Speaker.say()`, which runs the `piper-tts` Python package (onnxruntime, CPU) in a worker thread and writes a wav into a per-daemon temp dir; the path goes in `audio`. A medium voice loads in ~0.9 s at startup and voices a line in 60–150 ms, so the bubble lands a tenth of a second later than silent mode. The last three wavs are kept so a widget still playing one is not cut off. Silence is never an error: speech off, quiet hours, no voice installed, or a synthesis failure all mean "send the blob without `audio`", and `/health` says why under `speech.reason`. A caller that supplies its own `audio` keeps it. Emoji and dashes are stripped before synthesis; the bubble still shows them.
- **Voices** are Piper `.onnx` files in `~/.local/share/strawberry/voices/`. `bin/strawberry voices` lists them, `bin/strawberry voices en_US-amy-medium` downloads one (catalogue: rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples), `bin/strawberry audition` plays a sample line in each, `strawberryd --say TEXT [--voice V]` writes a wav for one. Installed: `en_GB-alba-medium` (default, Scottish, Panu's pick), `en_GB-jenny_dioco-medium` (warmer RP), `en_US-amy-medium` (brighter), `en_GB-alan-medium` (Scottish male).
- **Bubble:** a `Label3D` billboarded above the crab (`widget/bubble.gd`). Reveals characters over time, timed to the **audio duration** if `audio` present, or a text-length heuristic if silent (≈18 chars/s, clamped 1.6–9 s). Holds, fades, auto-hides, and signals `finished`. Tinted by `emotion`.
- **Audio-reactive claws (`widget/speech_player.gd`):** an `AudioStreamPlayer` on its own `Speech` bus carrying an `AudioEffectSpectrumAnalyzer`. Each frame it reads the 90–4000 Hz magnitude, maps −52…−16 dB to 0…1 through an envelope follower (fast attack, slower release), and writes it to the `claw_open_L/R` blend shapes at process priority 160, after the reaction recipes. When playback ends it writes 0 once and stops writing, so the claw controller's dance/think gestures own the morphs again. **The wav must play through Godot**; that's the only way the analyser sees it. Don't also send it to the system mixer. Godot's dummy audio driver still mixes, so the headless acceptance check measures the clack (0.78 mid-tone, 0 after).

**Silent mode falls out for free:** omit `audio` and you get a talking crab with a bubble and no sound. The model still writes the line. This is "quiet hours" (`speech.quiet_hours = "22:00-08:00"` in config, or `speech.enabled = false`), and it's the mode built **first** (§10).

---

## 7. Doorway: voice (STT)

- Hotkey → capture mic → **faster-whisper** (kept resident, model loaded once, CPU) → transcript.
- Transcript goes to the **action path** (§8) so speech can do things, not just chat.
- While capturing, send `{state:"listening"}`; while transcribing + thinking, `{state:"thinking"}`.
- The hotkey is bound as a **GNOME custom keyboard shortcut** that runs a one-line script POSTing to the daemon. GNOME owns the key, so it is identical on X11 and Wayland and the daemon never grabs keys itself.

---

## 8. Action path — MCP (last, and a real fork)

MCPHost is a good **interactive** pane for typing at the model, but the daemon needs to drive tool-calls **programmatically**. Two options:

- **Recommended:** run the tool loop inside the daemon with the **Python MCP SDK**. The daemon is already Python, and this keeps the whole action path in one process. MCPHost stays as the separate human terminal.
- Alternative: shell out to MCPHost if/when it exposes a non-interactive mode.

Either way, the servers are the existing MCPs unchanged (Spotify today, re:call/arxiv later). The loop: transcript → Ollama with tools → if tool call, run the MCP, feed result back → final text → `perform(...)`.

---

## 9. Naming contract (must match the GLB — do not rename)

```
states → clips:   idle→idle_loop  listening→listen_loop  thinking→think_loop
                  talking→talk_base  dancing→dance_loop
one-shots:        alert_snap   notify_perk
shape keys:       blink  squint  eye_wide  happy  claw_open_L  claw_open_R  squash  leg_tuck
bones:            root  body  eyestalk_L  eyestalk_R  claw_arm_L  claw_arm_R
materials:        mat_shell  mat_shell_dark  mat_claw  mat_cream  mat_eye  mat_ink
```

`talk_base` is the neutral talking pose; the clack is driven live via `claw_open_*`, **not** baked into the clip. The widget reuses the v2 runtime controllers (`blink_controller.gd`, `claw_controller.gd`, `cel_style.gd`, `skin_palettes.gd`) unchanged.

---

## 10. Build order (each phase independently testable)

1. **Contract + transport.** ✅ Daemon skeleton: HTTP intake + ws server + `perform()` that only forwards. Godot widget as ws client in a transparent always-on-top window. Test: `curl` a blob → crab changes state. No brain, no audio.
2. **Reaction path, silent.** ✅ git `post-commit` → `/event` → Ollama one-liner + emotion → blob with `text`, no `audio` → **bubble appears above the crab on commit.** Proves event → brain → face end to end with zero audio risk.
3. **Notifications doorway.** ✅ D-Bus monitor → same intake. Anything that notifies (including WhatsApp/Messenger) makes her react.
4. **TTS.** ✅ Piper → `audio` field → Godot plays it through the analysed bus → claws clack in time. `[speech]` in config turns it on.
5. **Voice in.** Hotkey → faster-whisper → transcript. Route to plain Ollama first to prove capture.
6. **MCP actions.** Wire the Python MCP client; voice commands start *doing* things (skip track, log to re:call).

Stop after any phase and you still have something that works.

---

## 11. Acceptance criteria

- [x] `curl` posting a contract blob to the daemon makes Godot change state / play a one-shot. (`scripts/check_phase1.sh`)
- [x] Bubble reveal is timed to text length when silent, to the wav length when spoken, and auto-hides.
- [x] Speech ends → crab returns to `idle` with no follow-up message from the daemon.
- [x] A `/event` round-trips through the reactor to the widget. (Canned reactor; model in Phase 2.)
- [x] Play/pause in any MPRIS media player makes her dance/idle; a track change shows a "Now playing" bubble and she returns to dancing. (`doorways/mpris_watch.py`)
- [x] The beat of the playing music picks a dance style and the clip runs at its tempo; synthetic 128/92/168 BPM drums are tracked to within 2 BPM with the phase on the kick. (`doorways/beat_watch.py`, `check_phase1.sh` step 14, `tests/test_beat_track.py`)
- [x] Browser origins are refused on HTTP and `/ws`; POSTs need the JSON content type.
- [x] A git commit makes Strawberry show a model-written bubble (silent). (`gemma3:1b` via `OllamaReactor`)
- [x] A desktop notification (any app) triggers a reaction. (`notify-send -a WhatsApp James "…"` → Gemma line in the bubble)
- [x] With TTS on, the wav plays through Godot and the claws clack to the audio; `claw_open_*` is 0 when idle. (`check_phase1.sh` step 11: 0 → 0.78 → 0; a missing wav is a 400)
- [ ] A voice command routed through MCP successfully calls one real tool (e.g. Spotify skip).

---

## 12. Notes for the human (Panu)

- **Two hops, not one.** Hooks hit the daemon over HTTP; only the daemon talks to Godot. Don't let a git hook open a websocket.
- **Godot is the ws client**, daemon is the server. Simpler, and it reconnects cleanly if you restart either side while iterating.
- **Silent-first** is the whole de-risking trick: you can prove the entire loop before touching audio.
- **One audio rule:** Piper's wav plays *through Godot*, or the analyser is blind and the clack dies.
- **CPU/GPU split:** whisper + Piper on CPU, Qwen keeps the 3090.
- **The MCP fork (§8)** is the one open design decision. Recommend the Python-SDK-in-daemon route so the action path stays in one process.

---

## 13. Desktop widget shell (Godot project `widget/`)

Strawberry lives on the desktop as a pet: a **frameless, transparent, always-on-top** window with **click-through** outside her silhouette. Four properties, set in `project.godot` and again in `widget.gd::setup_window()`:

| Property | Godot | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Transparent | `display/window/size/transparent`, `per_pixel_transparency/allowed`, viewport `transparent_bg`, clear colour alpha 0 | Only the crab is drawn |
| Borderless | `Window.borderless` | No frame or title bar |
| Always-on-top | `Window.always_on_top` | Floats over other windows |
| Click-through | `Window.mouse_passthrough_polygon` = padded convex hull of her meshes | Clicks beside her reach the desktop; clicks on her drag the window |

**X11 pin.** `bin/strawberry` launches Godot with `--display-driver x11`. On the current X11/GNOME session that is native. On a Wayland session it runs under XWayland, where Mutter still acts as the X window manager and honours the keep-above and position hints. Native Wayland clients on GNOME get neither (no layer-shell, no client positioning), so we don't take that path. Always-on-top and remembered position are treated as **best effort**: if a compositor ignores them she degrades to a normal frameless window, nothing breaks.

**Interaction.** Drag her body to move the window; the position is remembered in `user://widget.cfg` along with the skin, and clamped to the screen's usable area on restore. `Q` quits, `C` cycles skins. Cel shading and the ink outline are always on in the widget (the v2 preview's `O` toggle was a review aid, not a feature). The daemon can also send `{"command": "quit"}` or `{"command": "skin", "value": "mint"}`.

**Right-click menu (`widget/menu.gd`).** A `PopupMenu` drawn inside her transparent window: *Mute her voice*, *Quiet for an hour* (shows minutes left, click again to cancel), *Voice volume* (25–100 %), *Skin*, *Always on top*, then *Settings file…* (opens `config.toml` in the desktop's text editor, writing the template first if missing), *Apply settings* (runs `bin/strawberry restart`; the widget reconnects), *Voices folder…*, *Reset position*, *Quit*. Mute and quiet keep the bubble and drop only the sound, widget-side, so the daemon still voices lines and a second widget would still hear them. While the menu is open the passthrough polygon is cleared so the whole window takes clicks; it is recomputed on close. Every item has an explicit id: items added without one get their index as id, and a submenu row then steals a real row's check mark. Preferences persist in `user://widget.cfg` (`[audio] muted, quiet_until, volume`, `[window] always_on_top`).

**Pupils follow the cursor (`widget/gaze.gd`, `widget/strawberry_pupil.gdshader`).** No pupil bones: the pupil is a small ellipsoid baked into each eye mesh's ink surface, and the eye mesh is bound rigidly (weight 1) to its eyestalk bone. So each frame the widget passes the bone's pose to a variant of the cel shader as `to_rest`/`from_rest` (authored rest space ⇄ posed skeleton space); vertices that land within 0.034 of the authored pupil centre are rotated about the authored eyeball centre by a shared yaw/pitch, then sent back through the pose. Exact under any eyestalk bend or stretch, and the blend shapes (lids) are untouched. The gaze itself: the cursor's screen position (readable without focus on X11) is mapped to the crab's plane from the project window size and the orthographic camera (not `Camera3D.project_position`, which needs a real viewport), the direction from the midpoint between the eyes to that point, with the cursor imagined `LOOK_DEPTH` = 2.5 units in front of her, gives the angles, clamped to ±0.7 rad and eased at 14/s. Both pupils share one gaze. After 12 s of a still cursor she looks straight ahead. `--look=x,y` pins the cursor for captures and the headless check (step 13). `CelStyle.apply()` replaces surface materials on a skin change, so the widget re-applies the pupil material after it.

**Start on login.** `bin/strawberry install` writes three `systemd --user` units (`strawberryd.service`, which `Wants=` the two watcher units; the watchers are `PartOf=` it so a restart takes them along), enables them, and drops `~/.config/autostart/strawberry.desktop` that runs `bin/strawberry widget` a few seconds after the session starts. Once installed, `daemon/stop/restart/status` drive `systemctl --user` instead of pidfiles; logs move to `journalctl --user -u strawberryd`. `bin/strawberry uninstall` reverses it. The user manager already carries `DISPLAY` and the session bus address on this GNOME session, so the notification monitor works from a unit.

**Layout.** 380×560 window, orthographic camera (`KEEP_WIDTH`, size 1.25) centred at y 0.78, so the view spans y −0.14…1.70: the crab sits low and a bubble anchored at y 0.98 has room for five lines above her. The bubble lays each line out with `TextParagraph` (same font, width and wrapping as the `Label3D`) and shrinks the font in steps of 2 (44 → no smaller than 28) until the block fits the height between its anchor and the top of the view, so nothing is ever cut off; the badge sits at (0.5, 0.86), between the eyes and the bubble's bottom line, out of the text's way. `run/max_fps=60`, `gl_compatibility` renderer (same as the v2 preview).

**Reaction recipes (`widget/reactions.gd`).** A node at process priority 150 layers short procedural poses over whatever clip is playing, after the AnimationPlayer has written the frame, the same way the blink and claw controllers layer their morphs. Each recipe is an envelope (ease in, hold, ease out) on a few bone offsets and morphs; nothing is baked into the GLB, so a recipe is a dozen tunable lines. Bone axes from the rig: claw lift = local +X (`alert_snap` uses 37°), eyestalk sway = Z, body pitch = X, roll = Z. Every bone touched has a track in all seven clips, so the mixer resets it each frame and offsets never compound. (`SkeletonModifier3D` renders the same result, but its changes are invisible to `get_bone_global_pose()`, which the acceptance check uses to prove the lift; the plain node's are measurable: 48.5° during a wave, 0.7° after.)

| recipe | length | what moves |
|---|---|---|
| `wave` | 1.5 s | left claw arm lifts 48°, claw opens and closes twice, eyes wide |
| `peek` | 1.4 s | eyestalks stretch 35%, body leans 7° toward the viewer, eyes half wide |
| `shiver` | 0.9 s | body rolls ±3° at 18 Hz, shell squash jitters, squint |
| `double_hop` | 1.6 s | `notify_perk` played twice back to back, eyes wide throughout |
| `nod` | 1.1 s | body pitches ±10° twice, happy eyes |

Eye morphs go through `blink_controller` (`extra_wide` / `extra_happy` / `extra_squint`, combined with the clip-driven values) so the blink logic keeps ownership; claw and squash morphs are written directly at a later process priority and cleared when the recipe ends.

**Badge (`widget/badge.gd`).** A billboarded `Sprite3D` at the bubble's upper left showing the `icon` image (PNG/JPG, or SVG rasterised at load), visible while she talks, hidden with the bubble. **Window hop.** `hop: true` tweens the X11 window 26 px up and back with a small second bounce (0.47 s total); skipped while dragging or headless.

## 15. Settings

One file, `~/.config/strawberry/config.toml` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` respected). Defaults live in code (`strawberryd/config.py`), so the file only needs the lines you change. Read by the daemon at start and by the media watcher; `GET /config` shows the effective result. Unknown keys warn; wrong types refuse to start with the key named.

```toml
[daemon]

keep_alive = -1                  # seconds; -1 = stay in VRAM, or "10m" to unload when idle
# persona = """..."""           # her system prompt

[[brain.examples]]               # replaces the built-in five; the real lever on her voice

```

`bin/strawberry config` creates the file from a commented template (`strawberryd --init-config`) and opens it in `$EDITOR`; `bin/strawberry restart` applies it. `STRAWBERRYD_PORT` still overrides the port for scripts. The widget's own preferences (skin, window position) stay in Godot's `user://widget.cfg` for now.

## 14. Repository map

```
WIRING.md                this document
strawberryd/             Python daemon (uv project): contract, events/reactor, brain, speech (Piper), hub, server, tests
widget/                  Godot 4.7 desktop widget: widget.gd, ws_client.gd, bubble.gd, speech_player.gd, reactions.gd, dance_style.gd, gaze.gd, menu.gd, validate_widget.gd
                         + strawberry_v2.glb and the v2 shaders/controllers (copied from v2/godot_check)
doorways/                event producers: mpris_watch.py (any MPRIS media player), notify_watch.py (desktop notifications via D-Bus monitor), beat_watch.py + beat_track.py (tempo from the player's audio), git/ (global post-commit + pre-push hooks)
bin/strawberry           launcher: daemon + doorway watchers up, then widget on the X11 backend; say / voices / audition / install (start on login)
scripts/check_phase1.sh  Phase 1 acceptance: unit tests + headless widget against a real daemon
scripts/check_reconnect.sh  restart (or SIGNAL=KILL) the daemon under a headless widget; it must reconnect
v2/                      the asset: Blender build scripts, GLB, evidence, preview project
v1/ (top level)          the earlier deliverable
```

**Run it:** `bin/strawberry`. Then, from anywhere:

```bash
curl -s -H 'Content-Type: application/json' localhost:8770/perform \
  -d '{"state":"talking","anim":"alert_snap","text":"Did someone say my name?","emotion":"alert"}'
curl -s -H 'Content-Type: application/json' localhost:8770/event \
  -d '{"source":"git","title":"strawberry","body":"Add websocket"}'
```

Or press play in any media player: the MPRIS watcher (§4b) does the rest.
